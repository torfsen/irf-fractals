Fractals from Iterated Root-Finding Methods
===========================================
A small C program to calculate fractal images from iterated root-finding
methods other than [Newton's method][newton], for example from
[Householder's method][householder] or [Halley's method][halley]

See the comments in `main.c` for compilation and configuration instructions.
